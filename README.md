# Animais Fantasticos
#### This was a project in which I was manipulating the DOM with pure JS, making requests and changing elements of the DOM.
<p>You can access it <a href="https://victorfjansen.github.io/animais-fantasticos/">HERE</a></p>

### Como rodar em minha m√°quina?
<p> Simple. Just clone this repository in a directory on your machine and, on your console, give an "npm start"</p>
<p>After doing this, open the index.html with the liveserver</p>
